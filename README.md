An al·go·rithm is a self-contained step-by-step set of operations and procedures.

It is a procedure or recipe for solving a problem, based on conducting a sequence of specified actions. Executing an algorithm means following a precise list of steps in order to solve a problem, and the problem is usually turning an input into an output.
