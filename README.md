# Essential Algorithms

A procedure is a pattern for the local evolution of a computational process.

An al·go·rithm is a self-contained step-by-step set of operations and procedures.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm

It is a procedure or recipe for solving a problem, based on conducting a sequence of specified actions. Executing an algorithm means following a precise list of steps in order to solve a problem, and the problem is usually turning an input into an output.

The overall list of algorithms is huge.
